# React Filtering

This is a demo showing how to apply FILTERING on lists, in this case a list of apartments.

Demo: https://booking-filter.vercel.app

It shows combining MULTIPLE filter criteria including:

- Text search (e.g. for city or country)
- Matching by OR (e.g. EITHER Apartment OR House)
- Matching by AND (e.g. WLAN + Seaview)

The demo uses React CONTEXT to store the data centrally to make it easy to share the FILTER data between components.

The demo just focussed on the filter logic. No significant effort was taken to make it nice looking or responsie :)
